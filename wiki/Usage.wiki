#summary The goal of this page is to explain the ways in which ComplexNets++ can be used.

= Graphical mode =

To start the application in graphical mode, just call invoke the application whithout arguments from command line.
{{{
$> complexnets
}}}


= Command line mode =

ComplexNets++ can also run using the command line.

== Loading a graph from an input file ==

The syntax to load a graph from an input file is the following:
{{{
$> complexnets -i <filename>
}}}

If the file represents a weighted graph, the command must include the `--weighted` argument:
{{{
$> complexnets -i <filename> --weighted
}}}

== Creating a graph using a model ==

The graphs can also be created using a model. To achieve this, the command must have the following syntax:
{{{
$> complexnets <model_parameters>
}}}
Where `<model_parameters>` can take the following values depending on the used model:
 * Erdos-Renyi:
{{{
--erdos -n <number_of_nodes> -p <probability>
}}}
 * Barab√°si-Albert:
{{{
--barabasi -n <number_of_nodes> -c <number_of_initial_nodes> -m <number_of_attachment_nodes>
}}}
 * Extended Hot:
{{{
--hot
}}}
