ComplexNets++
C______N___++


This toolbox provides deferent tools to analyze complex networks, i.e.,
networks issues from complex systems or any graph in general. 
We provide:

	* Degree distribution
	* Knn: average neighbors degree distribution
	* Cnn: average cluster coefficient distribution
	* k-core shells 

We deal with several graphs types:
	* undirected 
	* weighted 
	* directed  (in a short term)
	* any combination (in a short term)

We also generate graphs according different models:
	* Erdös-Renyi
	* Bárabasi-Albert
	* Molloy-Reed
	* FKP-extended 


To copile it, find the instructions in src/README.txt
